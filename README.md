# ✨ INTELLI-GEN

Welcome to **INTELLI-GEN**! 🎉  
This project aims to generate **bulk image data** from 4–5 input images, addressing the problem of **dataset scarcity** by automating the creation of new, realistic images.  

- It’s especially useful for training **machine learning models** in image-based tasks like **computer vision** 🤖🖼️, where a large dataset is needed.

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository contains the following key elements:

### 📓 **fast-DreamBooth.ipynb**
- Based on the **DreamBooth** technique, this notebook fine-tunes a model using a small set of input images and generates new images reflecting their features.  
- 🔗 [Open fast-DreamBooth Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/JuhiGajjar/Intelli-Gen/blob/main/fast-DreamBooth.ipynb)

### 🧠 **Model Training Notebook**
- This notebook walks you through training the model on your own dataset, including setup and data preparation steps.  
- 🔗 [Open Model Training Notebook on GitHub](https://github.com/JuhiGajjar/Intelli-Gen/blob/main/model-training.ipynb)

### 🖼️ **Image Generation Pipeline**
- Outlines the process of generating new images from the trained model to expand your dataset.
